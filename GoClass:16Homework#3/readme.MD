>Exercise 4.12 from GOPL: fetching from the web
The popular web comic "xkcd" has a JSON interface. For example, a request to https://xcd.com/571/info.0.json produces a detailed description of comic 571, one of many favorites. Download each URL (once!) and build an offline index. Write a tool kcd that, using this index, prints the URL, date, and title of each comic whose title or transcript matches a list of search terms provided on the command line.
